**This is an Explanation page** - it helps you build a mental model of WebMCP. For hands-on learning, start with the [Your First Tool tutorial](/concepts/your-first-tool). For implementation details, see the [Quick Start](/quickstart).

## The Core Idea

WebMCP answers a simple question: **How can AI agents interact with websites reliably?**

The answer is equally simple: **Websites tell AI agents what they can do.**

Instead of AI trying to figure out how to click buttons and fill forms (fragile, slow, error-prone), websites explicitly expose their capabilities as structured **tools** that AI can discover and call directly.

## Three Key Concepts

### 1. Tools Are Functions with Contracts

A tool is a JavaScript function that AI agents can call. But unlike regular functions, tools come with:

- **A name** - How AI identifies the tool (`add_to_cart`, `search_products`)
- **A description** - When AI should use it ("Add a product to the shopping cart")
- **An input schema** - What parameters it accepts (product ID, quantity)
- **Predictable output** - Structured responses AI can understand

This contract means AI doesn't guess—it knows exactly what's available and how to use it.

### 2. The Browser is the Bridge

WebMCP runs in the browser, which provides unique advantages:

| Advantage | Why It Matters |
|-----------|----------------|
| **User session** | Tools inherit authentication—no OAuth needed |
| **User presence** | Humans see what AI is doing in real-time |
| **Existing UI** | Tools can update the page as they run |
| **Security** | Same-origin policy and browser sandbox apply |

The browser isn't just where tools run—it's where humans and AI collaborate.

### 3. Context is Dynamic

Unlike static APIs, WebMCP tools can appear and disappear based on application state:

- **Page-scoped**: Product page shows `add_to_cart`, checkout page shows `complete_purchase`
- **Role-scoped**: Admins see management tools, users see standard tools
- **State-scoped**: Empty cart hides checkout, filled cart shows it

This dynamic nature means AI only sees tools relevant to the current context—reducing confusion and errors.

## How WebMCP Fits In

### WebMCP vs MCP

WebMCP is inspired by Anthropic's [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) but designed specifically for browsers:

| | MCP | WebMCP |
|--|-----|--------|
| **Runs in** | Backend servers | Browser |
| **Designed for** | Server-to-agent communication | Human-in-the-loop workflows |
| **Authentication** | OAuth 2.1 | Inherits user session |
| **Visibility** | Logs, monitoring | User sees everything |

Both protocols are **complementary**:
- Use **MCP** for backend services, databases, and autonomous workflows
- Use **WebMCP** for browser-based interactions where users are present

### The MCP-B Implementation

Since browsers don't natively support `navigator.modelContext` yet, **MCP-B** provides:

1. **A polyfill** - Adds `navigator.modelContext` to any browser
2. **A bridge** - Translates WebMCP tools to MCP format for compatibility
3. **An extension** - Aggregates tools from tabs and connects to AI agents

When native browser support arrives, the polyfill becomes unnecessary—but your tools keep working.

## The Mental Model

Think of WebMCP as giving your website a **voice** that AI can understand:

```
Without WebMCP:
  AI: "I need to add this to cart... let me scan the page...
       is that the button? Maybe click there? Did it work?"

With WebMCP:
  AI: "I'll call add_to_cart with product_id='abc' and quantity=2"
  Tool: "Done. Cart now has 3 items totaling $45.99"
```

The website stops being a maze AI navigates and becomes a **collaborator** AI works with.

## Key Terminology

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Tool** | A function AI can call, defined by name, description, schema, and handler |
| **`navigator.modelContext`** | The browser API for registering tools (W3C standard, polyfilled by MCP-B) |
| **Transport** | How tools communicate between browser contexts (tabs, extension, iframes) |
| **MCP-B Extension** | Browser extension that aggregates tools and connects to AI agents |
