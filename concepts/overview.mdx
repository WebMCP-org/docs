This page explains the core concepts you'll encounter when working with WebMCP. Understanding these concepts helps you design better tools and troubleshoot issues.

## The Core Idea

WebMCP lets websites expose their functionality as **tools** that AI agents can call. Instead of teaching AI to click buttons and fill forms, you give AI direct access to your application's capabilities.

```javascript
// Your website exposes this tool
navigator.modelContext.registerTool({
  name: 'add_to_cart',
  description: 'Add a product to the shopping cart',
  inputSchema: { /* ... */ },
  async execute({ productId, quantity }) {
    // Your existing logic - same code a button click would run
  }
});

// AI agent calls it directly - no UI parsing needed
```

This is fundamentally different from browser automation (Playwright, Selenium, Computer Use), which requires AI to interpret pixels or DOM elements.

## Key Concepts

### Tools

A **tool** is a JavaScript function exposed to AI agents. Tools have:

- **Name** - Unique identifier (e.g., `cart_add_item`)
- **Description** - Tells AI when and how to use it
- **Input Schema** - Defines accepted parameters (Zod or JSON Schema)
- **Handler** - The function that executes when called

Tools are the primary way AI interacts with your application.

### Primitives

WebMCP supports three MCP primitives:

| Primitive | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Tools** | Actions the AI can perform | Add to cart, search products |
| **Prompts** | Pre-written prompt templates | "Summarize this page" |
| **Resources** | Read-only data access | Current user profile, page content |

Most applications only need tools.

### navigator.modelContext

The browser API where you register tools:

```javascript
navigator.modelContext.registerTool({ /* ... */ });
navigator.modelContext.registerPrompt({ /* ... */ });
navigator.modelContext.registerResource({ /* ... */ });
```

This API doesn't exist in browsers natively yet, so `@mcp-b/global` provides a polyfill.

### Transports

**Transports** handle communication between your website and AI agents. Common transports:

- **Tab Transport** - Between your page and the MCP-B browser extension
- **Extension Transport** - Between the extension and AI clients
- **Iframe Transport** - Between parent page and embedded iframes

You typically don't interact with transports directly - they work behind the scenes.

## WebMCP vs MCP

WebMCP is inspired by Anthropic's [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) but adapted for web browsers:

| Aspect | MCP | WebMCP |
|--------|-----|--------|
| **Environment** | Backend servers | Browser |
| **Use case** | Server-to-agent | Human-in-the-loop |
| **Authentication** | OAuth 2.1 | Inherits user session |
| **API** | MCP SDK | `navigator.modelContext` |

Both protocols are complementary:
- **Use MCP** for backend services and server-to-agent communication
- **Use WebMCP** for browser-based tools where users are present

## MCP-B: The Reference Implementation

Since browsers don't natively support `navigator.modelContext`, **MCP-B** provides:

1. **`@mcp-b/global` package** - Polyfill that adds `navigator.modelContext` to any browser
2. **MCP-B Browser Extension** - Aggregates tools from all tabs and exposes them to AI agents
3. **Transport packages** - Handle communication between contexts

## Mental Model

Think of WebMCP as giving AI a **remote control** for your website:

```
Without WebMCP:
AI → Looks at screen → Guesses where button is → Clicks → Hopes it worked

With WebMCP:
AI → Calls add_to_cart({id: "123", qty: 2}) → Gets structured response
```

The AI doesn't need to understand your UI - it just needs to know what tools are available and what they do.
