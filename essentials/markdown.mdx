## Titles

Best used for section headers.

```md
## Titles
```

### Subtitles

Best used for subsection headers.

```md
### Subtitles
```

<Tip>

Each **title** and **subtitle** creates an anchor and also shows up on the table of contents on the right.

</Tip>

## Text Styling

We support most markdown formatting. Simply surround text with the appropriate characters.

```md
**This is bold text**

_This is italic text_

~~This is strikethrough text~~
```

**This is bold text**

_This is italic text_

~~This is strikethrough text~~

You can combine these. **_This is bold and italic text_** by surrounding text with `**_` and `_**`.
