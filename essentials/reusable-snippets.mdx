## What are Snippets?

Snippets allow you to write content once and reuse it across multiple pages. This is especially useful for:

- Common warnings or notices
- Repeated setup instructions
- API authentication examples
- Consistent terminology definitions

## Creating Snippets

Create a `snippets` folder in your documentation root and add MDX files:

```md
<!-- snippets/auth-required.mdx -->
<Note>
  Authentication is required for this endpoint. Include your API key in the `Authorization` header.
</Note>
```

## Using Snippets

Import snippets into any page using the `<Snippet>` component:

```jsx
<Snippet file="auth-required.mdx" />
```

## Example Snippets

### Prerequisites Snippet

Create `snippets/prerequisites.mdx`:

```md
<Info>
  **Prerequisites:**
  - Node.js v18.0.0 or higher
  - npm or yarn package manager
  - Git installed on your system
</Info>
```

Use it in multiple pages:

```jsx
<Snippet file="prerequisites.mdx" />
```

### API Response Snippet

Create `snippets/api-response.mdx`:

```md
### Response

<ResponseField name="success" type="boolean" required>
  Indicates if the request was successful
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="data" type="object">
  The response data
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="error" type="string">
  Error message if the request failed
</ResponseField>
```

## Organizing Snippets

Structure your snippets folder for easy management:

```
snippets/
├── common/
│   ├── prerequisites.mdx
│   └── authentication.mdx
├── api/
│   ├── response-format.mdx
│   └── error-codes.mdx
└── setup/
    ├── installation.mdx
    └── configuration.mdx
```

Reference nested snippets:

```jsx
<Snippet file="common/prerequisites.mdx" />
<Snippet file="api/response-format.mdx" />
```

## Dynamic Content

Snippets can include dynamic content and components:

```md
<!-- snippets/feature-card.mdx -->
<Card title="Advanced Feature" icon="sparkles">
  This feature requires a Pro subscription. [Upgrade now](https://example.com/upgrade)
</Card>
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep snippets focused">
    Each snippet should serve a single purpose. Avoid creating overly complex snippets.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use descriptive names">
    Name snippets clearly to indicate their content and purpose.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Document snippet usage">
    Maintain a list of available snippets and their purposes for your team.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Version control">
    Track snippet changes carefully as they affect multiple pages.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: Ensure uniform content across documentation
- **Maintenance**: Update content in one place
- **Efficiency**: Reduce duplication and writing time
- **Accuracy**: Minimize errors from copy-pasting

<Tip>
  Use snippets for any content that appears in three or more places in your documentation.
