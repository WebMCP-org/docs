# MCP-B Extension

The MCP-B browser extension is a development and testing tool for WebMCP servers. It collects WebMCP tools from all your open tabs, lets you inject custom servers via userscript, and includes specialized AI agents to help you build and test web-based tools.

## Connect to Desktop AI with Native Host

<Info>
**Unlock the full power of WebMCP**: The native host bridges your browser tools to desktop AI assistants like Claude Code and Claude Desktop. This means you can use browser-based tools from your command line or desktop apps!

## Core Features

### AI Agents

Four specialized agents help you accomplish different tasks:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Userscript Engineer">
    **Build custom scripts to enhance websites**

    Perfect for adding features, removing clutter, or automating repetitive tasks. The Userscript Engineer helps you create production-grade userscripts through conversation.

    <Card title="Learn About Agents" icon="robot" href="/extension/agents">
      Understand when to use each agent
    </Card>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="WebMCP Server">
    **Turn websites into AI-accessible tools**

    Create userscripts that register MCP tools, making website functionality available to AI assistants. The WebMCP Server agent builds these specialized scripts for you.

    <Card title="Learn About Agents" icon="robot" href="/extension/agents">
      Understand when to use each agent
    </Card>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Browsing Agent">
    **Navigate and inspect web pages**

    Use the Browsing Agent to explore websites, extract information, and gather context. Ideal for research and monitoring tasks.

      Understand when to use each agent
    </Card>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Chat Companion">
    **Ask questions without automation**

    Have conversations, get explanations, and plan your approach before taking action. The Chat Companion focuses on conversation over automation.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Userscript Management

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Card title="Managing Userscripts" icon="gear" href="/extension/managing-userscripts">

</Card>

### MCP Tool Integration

The extension implements the Model Context Protocol, enabling:

- **Tool Discovery:** Automatically detect MCP tools on websites
- **Tool Execution:** Call website tools from AI agents
- **Tool Creation:** Build your own MCP servers as userscripts
- **Native MCP Support:** Connect to traditional MCP servers via native host

<Info>
WebMCP is a polyfill for the **W3C Web Model Context API** (`navigator.modelContext`) - a standards-track proposal for exposing website functionality to AI agents. The API supports **Zod schemas** (preferred) as well as JSON Schema for type-safe tool definitions.
</Info>

## Example: Building a Dark Mode

Here's how you'd use the extension to add dark mode to a website:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Userscript Engineer">
    Open the extension and choose "Userscript Engineer" from the agent dropdown
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to the site">
    Go to the website you want to customize
  </Step>

  <Step title="Request the feature">
    Type: "Add a dark mode toggle button that changes the background to #1a1a1a and text to #e0e0e0"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Agent builds and tests">
    The agent inspects the page, writes TypeScript code, and tests it
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and refine">
    See the changes live. Request adjustments if needed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save the script">
    The agent commits the script. It will now run automatically on that site
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example: Creating MCP Tools

Here's how to expose a website's search as an MCP tool:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select WebMCP Server">
    Open the extension and choose "WebMCP Server" from the agent dropdown
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to the site">
    Go to the website with the functionality you want to expose
  </Step>

  <Step title="Request the tools">
    Type: "Create MCP tools for searching this site and returning results"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Agent analyzes and builds">
    The agent inspects the search form, writes tool registration code, and tests it
  </Step>

  <Step title="Tools become available">
    After testing, the tools appear in your MCP tool list
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use from any agent">
    Any AI agent can now search that website on your behalf
  </Step>
</Steps>
