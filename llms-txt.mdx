## What is llms.txt?

The [llms.txt file](https://llmstxt.org) is an emerging industry standard that helps large language models (LLMs) and AI assistants index and understand documentation more efficiently. Similar to how `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` help search engines, `llms.txt` provides a structured overview of your documentation for AI tools.

When AI assistants like Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini need to answer questions about WebMCP, they can reference the `llms.txt` file to quickly locate relevant documentation pages.

## Automatic Generation

**Zero maintenance required.** Mintlify automatically generates and hosts both `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` files at the root of your documentation site. These files stay up-to-date automatically as you add, update, or remove pages.

### View Your Files

<div className="flex gap-3 flex-wrap mt-4">
  <PreviewButton href="https://docs.mcp-b.ai/llms.txt">
    View llms.txt
  </PreviewButton>
  <PreviewButton href="https://docs.mcp-b.ai/llms-full.txt">
    View llms-full.txt
  </PreviewButton>
</div>

Access these files by appending `/llms.txt` or `/llms-full.txt` to any documentation URL.

## File Structure

### llms.txt

An `llms.txt` file is a plain Markdown file containing:

* **Site title** - Your documentation site name as an H1 heading
* **Structured sections** - Organized groups of pages with links and descriptions
* **Page descriptions** - Pulled from the `description` field in each page's frontmatter

Pages are listed in alphabetical order by directory structure, starting from the root.

```mdx Example llms.txt
# WebMCP Documentation

## Getting Started

- [Introduction](https://docs.mcp-b.ai/introduction): W3C standard for making websites AI-accessible
- [Quickstart](https://docs.mcp-b.ai/quickstart): Build your first WebMCP server in 5 minutes
- [Examples](https://docs.mcp-b.ai/examples): Sample implementations and use cases

## Guides

- [Development](https://docs.mcp-b.ai/development): Build and test WebMCP servers
- [Advanced](https://docs.mcp-b.ai/advanced): Advanced patterns and optimization
```

This structured format enables AI assistants to:
- Quickly scan available documentation topics
- Navigate directly to relevant pages
- Understand the documentation hierarchy
- Provide accurate, context-aware responses

### llms-full.txt

The `llms-full.txt` file combines your **entire documentation site** into a single comprehensive file. This provides maximum context for AI assistants and is optimized for LLM processing.

<div className="mt-4">
  <PreviewButton href="https://docs.mcp-b.ai/llms-full.txt">
    View llms-full.txt
  </PreviewButton>
</div>

## Custom Files

You can override the automatically generated files by creating custom `llms.txt` or `llms-full.txt` files in the root of your project.

<Note>
  When you add a custom file, it completely replaces the automatic version. If you delete your custom file, the automatic generation resumes.
</Note>

### Requirements for Custom Files

Your custom files must include:

1. **Site title** as an H1 heading (required)
2. **Optional sections** per the [llms.txt specification](https://llmstxt.org/#format)

See the [format documentation](https://llmstxt.org/#format) for best practices on structuring custom content.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Add descriptions to all pages">
    Every MDX file should include a `description` field in its frontmatter. This description appears in the `llms.txt` file and helps AI assistants understand page content at a glance.

    ```mdx
    ---
    title: 'My Page'
    description: 'Clear, concise summary of page content'
    ---
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keep descriptions concise">
    Aim for 10-20 words that clearly explain what the page covers. Focus on keywords relevant to common search queries.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use consistent terminology">
    Maintain consistent terminology across descriptions to help AI assistants recognize related concepts. For WebMCP docs, use standard terms like "MCP-B", "navigator.modelContext", "tab transport", etc.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Let automatic generation handle updates">
    Unless you have specific customization needs, rely on automatic generation. Manual maintenance of `llms.txt` files can become outdated quickly.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## SEO Benefits

While designed for AI assistants, `llms.txt` files also provide SEO benefits:

- **Improved discoverability** - AI-powered search tools can better index your documentation
- **Structured data** - Clear content hierarchy signals quality to search engines
- **Better AI integration** - As AI becomes more integrated with search, proper `llms.txt` implementation future-proofs your docs
- **Enhanced user experience** - Users asking AI assistants questions get more accurate documentation references

<Tip>
  The `llms.txt` standard is growing rapidly. Early adoption positions your documentation for the AI-powered search era.
