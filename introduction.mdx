## Welcome to WebMCP

<Warning>
**Early Incubation**: The WebMCP API is currently being incubated by the [W3C Web Machine Learning Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/webmachinelearning/). The standard is still evolving, and not all features implemented by MCP-B may be included in the final WebMCP specification. APIs and patterns documented here are subject to change as the standard matures.
</Warning>

With WebMCP, your existing JavaScript functions become discoverable tools. Rather than relying on browser automation or remote APIs, agents get deterministic function calls that work reliably and securely.

### The Problem

AI assistants are great at conversation, but they can't reliably interact with your website. They can't click buttons, submit forms, or access your app's functionality in a structured, deterministic way.

### The Solution

**WebMCP** is a W3C web standard (currently being incubated by the [Web Machine Learning Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/webmachinelearning/)) that lets websites expose structured tools to AI agents through the `navigator.modelContext` API. AI assistants can then help users by directly calling your website's functionality - all while respecting authentication and permissions.

### Design Philosophy

WebMCP is built on a **human-in-the-loop** philosophy:

- **The human web interface remains primary** - WebMCP doesn't replace your UI
- **AI agents augment, not replace** - Tools assist users, they don't work autonomously
- **Users maintain control** - Visibility and oversight over all agent actions
- **Collaborative workflows** - Humans and AI work together, not separately
- **Context engineering** - Like good web design guides users, good WebMCP guides AI by exposing the right tools at the right time

### What WebMCP Is NOT

WebMCP is specifically designed for human-in-the-loop workflows. It is **not** intended for:

<Warning>
These use cases are explicitly out of scope for WebMCP and should use other solutions.
</Warning>

- **Headless browsing** - WebMCP requires an active browsing context with the user present
- **Fully autonomous agents** - Tools are designed to augment, not replace, human interaction
- **Backend service integration** - For server-to-agent communication without a UI, use the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
- **UI replacement** - The human web interface remains the primary interaction method

### Key Terms

For detailed terminology, see the [Glossary](/concepts/glossary). Key concepts:

- **WebMCP**: W3C Web Model Context API standard for exposing website tools to AI agents
- **MCP-B**: Reference implementation that polyfills `navigator.modelContext` and bridges WebMCP with MCP
- **MCP-B Extension**: Browser extension for building, testing, and using WebMCP servers

## Why Use WebMCP?

- **Standards-Based**: Implements the W3C Web Model Context API proposal
- **Zero Backend**: Runs entirely in the browser - no server changes needed
- **Respects Auth**: Tools inherit your user's session and permissions
- **Framework Agnostic**: Works with React, Vue, vanilla JS, or any framework
- **Developer Friendly**: Simple API with React hooks for easy integration
- **Type Safe**: Full TypeScript support with Zod validation

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add WebMCP to your site">
    Install `@mcp-b/global` to enable `navigator.modelContext`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Register your tools">
    Turn your JavaScript functions into AI-accessible tools with `registerTool()`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect AI agents">
    Install the MCP-B Extension or integrate with AI frameworks like Assistant-UI
  </Step>
  <Step title="AI calls your tools">
    AI assistants can now discover and use your tools to help users
  </Step>

## Understanding the Standards

WebMCP builds on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), adapting it for the web platform:
