# What is WebMCP?

WebMCP (Web Model Context Protocol) is a W3C web standard for making websites AI-accessible.

Using WebMCP, AI assistants like Claude or ChatGPT can interact with your website's functionality directly—enabling them to help users complete tasks, access information, and navigate complex workflows.

Think of WebMCP like a **USB-C port for websites**. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect devices, WebMCP provides a standardized way for AI agents to connect to your website's features.

## What can WebMCP enable?

* Users can ask an AI assistant to book a table at a restaurant while browsing the restaurant's website.
* AI agents can help users fill out complex multi-step forms by calling your site's functions directly.
* Shopping assistants can add items to your cart, apply discounts, and help compare products—all through your existing website code.
* Enterprise web apps can expose specialized tools to AI, letting employees use chat to perform tasks that normally require clicking through multiple pages.

## Why does WebMCP matter?

Depending on where you sit in the ecosystem, WebMCP can have a range of benefits.

* **Website developers**: WebMCP turns your existing JavaScript functions into AI-accessible tools with minimal code changes—no backend required.
* **AI applications or agents**: WebMCP provides a standardized way to interact with any website that implements the protocol, creating an ecosystem of web-based tools.
* **End-users**: WebMCP enables AI assistants to help with real tasks on real websites, making AI more practical and useful in everyday browsing.
