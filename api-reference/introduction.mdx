## Welcome

Welcome to the API Reference documentation. Here you'll find comprehensive information about our API endpoints, authentication methods, and response formats.

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication. You can authenticate using an API key in the request header:

```bash
curl https://api.example.com/v1/endpoint \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.example.com/v1
```

## Response Format

All responses are returned in JSON format:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    // Response data here
  },
  "error": null
}
```

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes:

| Status Code | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| 200 | Success |
| 400 | Bad Request |
| 401 | Unauthorized |
| 404 | Not Found |
| 500 | Internal Server Error |

## Rate Limiting

API requests are limited to:
- 1000 requests per hour for free tier
- 10000 requests per hour for pro tier
