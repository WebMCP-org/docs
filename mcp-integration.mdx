# WebMCP Documentation via MCP

> Connect your AI agent to WebMCP documentation for instant access to guides, examples, and API references

Give your AI assistant access to the complete WebMCP documentation through our Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. Your agent can explore the docs, find code examples, and help you implement WebMCP features.

## What is MCP?

MCP is a protocol for integrating tools with AI agents. It greatly enhances the capabilities of your AI agents by providing them with real-time data and context.

The WebMCP documentation MCP server allows your AI assistant to explore and search this documentation site. When connected, your agent can help you by finding relevant guides, pulling up code examples, and answering questions about WebMCP implementation.

## How does it work?

You need an MCP-capable agent environment to connect to the WebMCP documentation server. Popular options include Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and ChatGPT.

Once connected, your AI assistant can explore the documentation to help you:
- Find relevant guides and tutorials
- Locate specific code examples and patterns
- Answer questions about WebMCP features and APIs
- Troubleshoot integration issues
- Understand best practices and implementation details

## Connecting to the Documentation Server

The WebMCP documentation is available via MCP at `https://docs.mcp-b.ai/mcp`.

When your client supports direct URL configuration, use:
```
https://docs.mcp-b.ai/mcp
```

For command-based configuration, use:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "WebMCP Docs": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://docs.mcp-b.ai/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Setup Instructions by Client

    }
  }
}
```

Restart Cursor to enable documentation access for your AI assistant.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Windsurf" icon="wind">

In `mcp_config.json`, add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "WebMCP Docs": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://docs.mcp-b.ai/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Windsurf to enable documentation access for your AI assistant.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Codex" icon="terminal">

Add the following to your `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.webmcp_docs]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://docs.mcp-b.ai/mcp"]
```

Restart Codex to enable documentation access for your AI assistant.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="ChatGPT" icon="message">

<Note>
MCP is only available for paid users in beta on ChatGPT web, by enabling Developer Mode.
</Note>

1. Enable **Developer Mode** in ChatGPT settings
2. Go to **Settings** → **Connectors**
3. Click **Add MCP server**
4. Add `https://docs.mcp-b.ai/mcp` as the server URL

<Accordion title="VS Code (Cline Extension)" icon="code">

If you're using the Cline extension for VS Code:

1. Open VS Code settings
2. Navigate to Cline extension settings
3. Find **MCP Servers** configuration
4. Add a new server with:
   - **Name**: WebMCP Docs
   - **URL**: `https://docs.mcp-b.ai/mcp`
5. Save and restart VS Code

Alternatively, edit your Cline configuration file directly:

```json
