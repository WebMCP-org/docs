# WebMCP over Model Context Protocol (MCP)

> Extend the capabilities of your AI agents with WebMCP's MCP Server

Supercharge your AI agents with WebMCP documentation access via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.

## What is MCP?

MCP is a protocol for integrating tools with AI agents. It greatly enhances the capabilities of your AI agents by providing them with real-time data and context.

WebMCP offers a remote MCP server that you can connect to from most AI clients, giving your assistants instant access to WebMCP documentation, code examples, and best practices.

## How does it work?

You need an MCP-capable agent environment to use WebMCP over MCP. Popular options include Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and ChatGPT.

Once connected, your AI assistant can search and reference WebMCP documentation to help you:
- Implement WebMCP in your applications
- Troubleshoot integration issues
- Find relevant code examples
- Understand best practices and patterns

## Connecting to WebMCP MCP

When you can specify an MCP URL, use `https://docs.mcp-b.ai/mcp`.

If you have to specify a command, use:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "WebMCP": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://docs.mcp-b.ai/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Setup Instructions by Client

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Claude Code" icon="robot">

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http "WebMCP" "https://docs.mcp-b.ai/mcp"
```

Once added, Claude Code will have access to WebMCP documentation when you're working on projects.

<Info>
See the [Claude Code documentation](./tools/claude-code) for more ways to optimize your WebMCP development workflow.

```

Restart Cursor for the changes to take effect.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Windsurf" icon="wind">

In `mcp_config.json`, add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "WebMCP": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://docs.mcp-b.ai/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Windsurf to connect to the WebMCP documentation server.
