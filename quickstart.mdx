## Setup your development

Learn how to update your docs locally and deploy them to production.

### Edit and preview

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone your docs locally">
    During onboarding, we created a repository on your GitHub account with your docs content.
    
    You can clone this repository locally and make changes to the content.
    
    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash Terminal
      git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/[your-repo-name].git
      ```

      npm i -g mintlify
      ```
      ```bash yarn
      yarn global add mintlify
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
    
    Run the following command at the root of your documentation:
    
    ```bash
    mintlify dev
    ```
