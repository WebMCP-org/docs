<Info>
  **Prerequisites** You should have installed Node.js (version 18.0.0 or higher) and pnpm package manager.
</Info>

## Getting Started

Step 1. Clone the WebMCP repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MiguelsPizza/WebMCP.git
cd WebMCP
```

Step 2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Step 3. Build shared packages first:

```bash
pnpm build:shared
```

Step 4. Start development mode:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This runs all applications in development mode with hot reloading.

## Development Ports

The WebMCP development environment uses the following ports:

- **Main dev server**: 5173-5174
- **Extension dev server**: 3000  
- **Native host**: 12306

Make sure these ports are available before starting development.

└── e2e-tests/             # End-to-end tests
```

## Building Specific Components

### Extension Development

For extension-specific development with hot reloading:

```bash
pnpm --filter @mcp-b/extension dev
```

### Building Extension for Production

```bash
pnpm --filter @mcp-b/extension build
```

The built extension will be available in `./apps/extension/.output/chrome-mv3` for loading as an unpacked extension.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Git clone times out">
    If the initial clone fails, complete it manually:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MiguelsPizza/WebMCP.git
    cd WebMCP
    git pull origin main
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Native server postinstall errors">
    These errors during `pnpm install` are normal and can be ignored:
    ```
    Cannot find module '/path/to/apps/native-server/dist/scripts/postinstall.js'
    ```
    The packages will still build correctly.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Import resolution errors">
    For monorepo development, ensure the workspace is properly built:
    ```bash
    pnpm build:shared  # Build internal shared packages
    pnpm build:apps     # Build all applications
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Port conflicts">
    If you encounter port conflicts, check that the following ports are available:
    - Main dev server: 5173-5174
    - Extension dev server: 3000
    - Native host: 12306
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Extension not detecting tools">
    1. Ensure the extension is installed and enabled
    2. Refresh the page after starting your MCP server
    3. Check the extension popup "Tools" tab
    4. Look for console errors in browser DevTools
